# TararauBot ðŸ¤–
TararauBot is a foul mouthed Telegram Chatbot that was created... on a boring day ðŸ™ƒ. So his main purpose is still uncertain but one thing is for sure - he will make you and your friends laugh a couple times with his mocking persona.

What else can he do? Aside the jokes and jest banters, for now he can assist you and your group of friends in managing your [RolÃªs](https://www.dicionarioinformal.com.br/rol%C3%AA/) (meetups). I personally find him much more useful when used in groups of friends for this purpose.

**Bonus**: He won't forget (and *will* remind you) of your and your friends' birthdays ðŸŽ‰

## Installation ðŸš€
You'll need the following applications in your machine in order to run TararauBot locally:

- NodeJS
- Yarn
- Docker

You will also need a *telegram chatbot api key* that you can get with [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather)

Once you've cloned the project, rename the `.env-example` file to `.env` and fill it with the *telegram chatbot api key*. With that done, you can run the following command to download the dependencies and start the development server:

```
yarn && yarn dev
```

## Deployment ðŸ“¦

Create the environment variables `BASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL` in your Heroku application.

You can use the `Procfile` to deploy on your [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/nodejs) application and in your Telegram Account to sync with it.

Here's a [tutorial](https://medium.com/matheus-rossi/telegram-bot-com-nodejs-9e107153046b) to set a chatbot with NodeJS.
